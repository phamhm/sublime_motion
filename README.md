#Sublime Motion#
*What it does:*

Enable jumping to any place on your screen.

Features: 

1. Mark every word on all your group, and enable jumping to any word in active group

2. Input any char, and jump to selected char in active view. 

3. Input any word, and jump to selected word in active view

4. In multiple cursor mode, you can choose a mark and jump there. In this mode, your selected mark and original cursor position will be maintained. 

TODO:

1. Visual mode selection from current cursor position to mark

2. redraw label when a single character mark is the first letter of the double-character marks. At this moment, can only jump to the single character mark. Need to enable redraw or maybe remark. 

3. Enable features to input multiple marks for selection by providing a list of marks in view. Need to work to make simple ranges to work as well.
